# news_website
In this project, I have made a simple news taking site using the NEWS API. 
Here I have wrote my own CSS and not used any framework like CSS.
In the JavaScript part, I have used Fetch Api for getting the JSON data from the server and displayed it on a interactive UI.

# To use this:-
Step 1): Open git bash.
Step 2): Paste the code ---> git clone https://github.com/shubbhuf23/news_website
Step 3): Paste the code ---> code .
Step 4): Open 'index.html' file and then right click on it and select "Open with the live server" option.
This is done because it needs a server to fetch data from the NEWS API and display it.
